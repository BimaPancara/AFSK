This repository contain Audio Frequency Shift Keying Implemented in GNURadio and HackRF

The implementation on HackRF are usable below 3GHz

Make sure to change the frequency at receiver side, since the further the distance between TX and RX, the frequency at the receiver will move down the spectrum.
